XORBind requests 1 number on loop to binary xor to the other bound number

DDTI generates a 16x16 Differential Distribution Table in matrix 6, takes about 3 minutes, expects f(x) of your S-box in list L1
DDTR generates a single row of the above, so takes 1/16th the time :p 

MODGAUSS does modular guassian elemination on matrix
